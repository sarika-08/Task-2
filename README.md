# Task-2
Basic CRUD Application built using PHP &amp; MySQL as part of my internship at Apex Planet Software Pvt Ltd. Features: Create, Read, Update, Delete posts, along with secure User Authentication using password hashing and session management.
Excited to share my progress from my internship journey at Apex Planet Software Pvt Ltd!

As part of the internship, I had the opportunity to work on Task 2: Basic CRUD Application — a project focused on building a web application using PHP and MySQL.

In this task, I developed a simple yet essential web system to perform CRUD operations:
✔ Create — Add new posts to the database.
✔ Read — Display a list of posts on the web page.
✔ Update — Edit existing posts.
✔ Delete — Remove posts from the system.

Along with CRUD functionality, I implemented User Authentication, including:

Registration and Login forms.

Secure password hashing.

Session management for user login states.


This task not only improved my understanding of database interactions but also strengthened my backend development and security knowledge.

Check out the video for a short explanation of the project!
